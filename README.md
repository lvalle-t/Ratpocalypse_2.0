	In the year 2050, genetic experiments on rats have resulted in the mutated rats gaining intelligence much higher than that of humans. These intelligent rats rid the world of humans and created a virus that spread through the world like wildfire, causing the infected to be subservient and controlled by the Rat King with a hivemind. The infected hunted down the cats to kill them, but those who were able to get away hid in the underground sewers. If any of the Rat King’s soldiers were to find them, the cat community would perish. 

Our game, Ratpocalypse: Rise of the Cat Warrior, will be a top-down, 2D, pixel, roguelike game. The game follows a playable Cat Warrior that ventures out to protect their home after it is nearly exposed to the Rat King’s soldiers. He must get to the Rat King to get rid of him and finds himself fighting the infected along the way. The Cat Warrior will face many underlings, from fire-breathing fire ants to sword-wielding rats, who will go after the player to eliminate yet another “cat”. After facing these underlings, the Cat Warrior will face difficult bosses such as the alligator lurking in the sewers and the mole appearing to block the player’s path. Once at the Rat King’s headquarters located at Petcorp, the Cat Warrior will find mobs swarming it from the aisles until the player reaches the Rat King’s office. Where the Rat King summons its underlings until it is forced to come down and face the Cat Warrior himself. 

	Throughout the Cat Warrior’s battles, the Cat Warrior will collect cat treats to upgrade its strength or purchase items. With each boss killed, the player will gain an antidote piece, that combines to create the final antidote curing the world of the infection; once the Rat King is dead.
